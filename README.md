 ## Description 
 Leona's cat café is a cosy place to hang out with friends, work or have a relaxing time accompanied by shelter cats that are up for adoption. All the drinks and food are high-quality and plant-based. 

## User demographic
Leona's cat café is for anyone who likes cats and wants a serotonin booster along with good coffee and pastries. This makes the café appealing to people all ages, from families with children to teenagers or young couples and of course senior citizens. When it comes to gender, the cat café demographic is dominated by women. 
Leona's cat café is located in the suburban area Kärrtorp in the south of Stockholm. This area is known for being calm and trendy and is mostly populated by senior citizens, young families, young couples and young professionals. This makes Kärrtorp the ideal location for a cat café.      
 

## Features
Leona's cat café is a website with three pages: 1)a home page introducing the café with a brief "about" section about the business and the menu, 2)a page with pictures and description of the resident cats to meet or adopt, 3) a form page to book a visit.

#### Footer
The footer contains the address and opening hours of the café as well as links to the social media of Leona's cat café. An embedded google maps link was placed at the beginning but it has been replaced with a screenshot of the map instead since the link produced errors.

#### Gallery "our cats"
The 'Our Cats' page functions as a gallery and shows the user more of what they will experience at the café. In this case it is of course the cats they will get to meet.

#### Technologies used
The website "Leona's cat café" has been built with html and CSS.
The IDE used has been codeanywhere and the repository has been hosted in the platform Github. 
#### Design
##### Choice of color palette 
Pastels and pink are trendy and appeal to the demographic who dominates in cat cafés. That is why I chose a bold but still soft pink-salmon shade and a cream shade combined  with dark brown text to achieve a good contrast. 
I used https://mycolor.space/ for inspiration and experimented until I found the right combination. 

###### Combinations suggested by https://mycolor.space/

###### Final combination of my choice

I chose 'Tilt Neon' (sans-serif) as the only font for a playful, yet sleek look to the website.
